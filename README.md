# DoublepulsarCPP - WARNING: Code is non functional and not working at this time.  It is being updated time permitting.
The purpose of this project is to create a DoublePulsar interface application using dynamic packet generation and not using hexadecimal captures.<br /><br />
This will make it easier to create DoublePulsar execution packets without running into issues.
